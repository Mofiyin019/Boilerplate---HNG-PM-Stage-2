# Boilerplate for Telex.
Telex is a notification hub similar to Slack, but itâ€™s designed to inform developers about bugs in their applications. 
This way, they can easily identify and resolve these bugs before they escalate. 
It will also inform the developer when a new user signs up on the application and all the activities they perform.
